## Building

To compile the backend:

Also ensure that you have a MySQL instance running with a database named `bookeroo` before you run the application.

## Running 

To run the application locally:

 - Navigate into the `BackEnd/loginmicroservices` folder
 - Run `java -jar target/loginmicroservices-0.0.1.jar`
 - Navigate into the `FrontEnd/myfirstapp` folder
 - Run `npm install`
 - Run `npm start`

## Documentation

A copy of the documentation can be found in the `docs/` folder.

You also likely received a .zip file containing the documentation files along with this submission, which is more likely to contain the most up-to-date version of the documentation.
